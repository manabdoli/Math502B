# Initial Plan

You're absolutely right‚Äî**Julia** is excellent for parallel and high-performance computing, and it's a great choice for exposing students to scalable ML workflows. Given your structure of **14 weekly sessions**, we can design a curriculum that blends **ML theory**, **hands-on coding in R, Python, and Julia**, and culminates in **Neural Networks and LLMs**. Each session will include:

- A **core ML concept**
- A **short theoretical overview**
- **Sample code** in at least two languages (R, Python, Julia where appropriate)
- Optional **parallelization or HPC notes**
