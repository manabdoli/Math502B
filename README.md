# Math502B (based on ISLR)

Math 502B is primarily designed based on ISLR ([Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/)). 
The [ISLR's Resources for the Second Edition](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-second-edition) provides datasets, R codes, and R markdown (Rmd) files. 

This repository is created as a a gateway for students to those resources, and as a tool for students to

- get started with using GitHub,
- practicing by, for example, updating the original R and Rmd files, and
- showcasing their own work (projects).
